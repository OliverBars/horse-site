Here I use SCSS (variables, nesting) and JavaScript (jQuery), specifically for a dropdown burger menu. 
I also adhere to the BEM methodology and emphasize semantic coding practices.
Additionally, I have incorporated responsiveness using media queries to ensure the 
website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
